# Cybersecurity-Projects-Portfolio
Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio on threat modeling, Risk analysis, Incident Response, Python automation, Splunk and Linux

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio , a collection of hands-on projects demonstrating my experience in incident response, security analysis, risk assessment, access control, and automation. These projects reflect my ability to apply industry frameworks, tools, and programming to solve real-world security challenges. Below are the details of my projects;

üö® Incident Response & Network Security
Ransomware Incident Simulation: Documented a ransomware attack scenario in a healthcare setting, detailing detection, analysis, containment, and recovery phases using the NIST incident response framework.
DNS Outage Analysis: Investigated a client website outage using tcpdump, identifying a DNS resolution issue caused by unreachable UDP port 53 and escalating to security engineers.
DDoS Response Strategy: Analyzed a DDoS attack on internal systems, traced the source to ICMP flooding via an unconfigured firewall, and proposed mitigation strategies including IDS/IPS, firewall updates, and IP spoofing protections.
Packet Capture & Analysis: Gained practical experience with Wireshark and tcpdump to capture and interpret network traffic, enhancing my ability to detect suspicious activity in real time.

üõ°Ô∏è Risk & Compliance
Internal IT Audit (Toy Company): Conducted a full audit for a fictious U.S.-based toy company using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Evaluated risk, asset management, and compliance with online payment regulations and E.U. data protection standards.[Botium Toys_ Scope, goals, and risk assessment report.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20866341/Botium.Toys_.Scope.goals.and.risk.assessment.report.pdf),[Controls and compliance checklist.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20866362/Controls.and.compliance.checklist.pdf)

Public Database Vulnerability Assessment: Identified risks in a globally accessible e-commerce database and provided actionable recommendations to reduce exposure and support compliance.[Vulnerability assessment report .pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20866397/Vulnerability.assessment.report.pdf)

Threat Modeling with PASTA: Performed a seven-stage threat model for a sneaker marketplace mobile app to define security requirements and protect against threats pre-launch. [PASTA Framework.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20866402/PASTA.Framework.pdf)

üß™ Security Tools & Automation
Malware Analysis with VirusTotal: Investigated a malicious file hash from a phishing email, reinforcing the importance of endpoint monitoring and employee awareness training.
Access Control in Kali Linux: Managed file and directory permissions using ls -la and chmod in Kali Linux to enforce proper authorization protocols across organizational assets. [File permissions in Linux .pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20866414/File.permissions.in.Linux.pdf)

SQL-Based Threat Investigation: Used SQL to query and filter employee login activity, identifying patterns of suspicious access attempts for further review.

Python Scripting for IP Whitelisting: Automated secure access management to healthcare systems by developing a Python script to clean the IP allow list based on a removal list, enhancing data protection and operational efficiency.[Update a file through a Python algorithm.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20866440/Update.a.file.through.a.Python.algorithm.pdf)


üß† What I have Learned so far;
Through these projects, I have built a solid foundation in incident handling, vulnerability assessment, network traffic analysis, threat modeling, and automation. I am continually learning and committed to improving security posture across systems through practical, scalable solutions.
